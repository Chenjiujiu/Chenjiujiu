## 💻 About Me

I'm a full-stack engineer with a strong focus on frontend architecture, native JavaScript, and browser internals.

I enjoy dissecting how things work under the hood — from the DOM rendering pipeline and event loop to the V8 engine's bytecode and JIT optimizations. Whether it's closures, scopes, or the intricacies of `this`, I love diving into the edge cases and making them simple for users.

Currently, I build fast, reliable, and scalable apps using **javascript**,**React**,**React Native**, **Node.js**, and **Shopify**. I'm also a big fan of automation, performance tuning, and writing clean, maintainable code.

When I'm not coding, I'm likely refactoring something that didn’t need to be refactored… just for fun.
